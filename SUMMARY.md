# Executive & Technical Summary: Sovereign-Talent-Engine

### 1. System Purpose and Business Value
The Sovereign-Talent-Engine is a proprietary intelligence system developed by PointSav Digital Systems AG for Woodfine Management Corp. (MCorp). Its primary function is the conversion of raw, unverified professional data into a high-fidelity "Personnel Substrate." By applying a proprietary 20-Point Digital Twin scoring model, the engine creates a proprietary database that predicts professional trajectory and identifies "Archetype Lookalikes" for high-stakes recruitment.

### 2. Core Architectural Logic
The system utilizes a Sovereign Host/Node Architecture:
* **The Host (iMac 12.1):** Central authority and secure vault. Manages relational integrity of the `people.db` substrate.
* **Elastic Bonding:** Maps "Professional Elasticity" by tracking historical transitions between individuals and corporate entities as permanent data points.
* **The Nodes (Mac OS X Units):** Distributed processing layer. Human operators resolve data ambiguities via "Information Gain" tasks delegated by the Host.

### 3. The Substrate Lifecycle (Chain of Custody)

1. **Ingestion:** Raw data is pulled in (`extract`), assigned a Sovereign ID, and source-tagged.
2. **Structuring:** The record is placed into the relational substrate (`init`) as a "Socket."
3. **Delegation:** The API Bridge (`bridge`) serves priority queues to available Nodes.
4. **Verification:** Human operators confirm identity (`discovery`) via "Glance-and-Tap."
5. **Maturation:** An automated daemon (`maturated`) enriches the record with deep-text context.
6. **Auditing:** Matured profiles are aggregated into "Archetype" segments for reporting (`audit`).
